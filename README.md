# cs50x-submissions
My CS50x coursework submissions.

This is a space where I record my CS50x coursework submissions. 

I am currently learning to code and all of the code posted is my own.

Submissions:

pset1
- mario: This program builds a pyramid of 'hashes' like in the mario game. The user inputs the height of the hashes (between 1 and 8) and the pyramid is based on this.
- cash: This code asks for a float from a user which represents an amount of change, it then works out the fewest number of coins needed to make up the total amount. It assumes that the only coins available are quarters (25¢), dimes (10¢), nickels (5¢), and pennies (1¢).
- credit: This program verifies whether a credit card number is valid or not using Luhn's Algorithm. It prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via printf) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number.

pset2
- triangle: This short program takes in three numbers which represent the sides of a triangle. It will tell the user whether the triangle is valid or not based on these lengths.
- readability: This program takes in text and outputs the grade level of the text.
- caesar: This program is used to 'encrypt' text input by the user. A command line argument must be used to give an 'int' which encrypts the text by using this number with the ASCII system for the characters.
- substitution: This program is a more advanced 'encrypting' program than caesar. Rather than a number, this takes a substitution cipher key as a command line argument which is 26 letters long and only contains one of each letter in the alphabet. A user inputs their text (plaintext) and is encrypted by the key to output the amended text (ciphertext) which can only be read by those who know the cipher key.
